###Movie Reviews

This is an example of how to use both SkiLean MulltiNominal Naive Bayes classifier and NLTK Naive Bayes classifier, with respect to Movie Reviews.

This project illustrates how to:
* Cleaning of text data
* Create a vectorizer in SkiLearn
* Creating your own feature extractor
* Break data into training and test data
* Use FreqDist from NLTK
* Use MultiNomialNB implementation from SkiLearn
* Use NaiveBayes implementation from NLTK.Classify
* What Recall, Precision, F1 and accuracy are
* Confusion matrix formation
