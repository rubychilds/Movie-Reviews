      "This is an example of how to use both SkiLean MulltiNominal Naive Bayes classifier and NLTK Naive Bayes classifier, with respect to Movie Reviews. The Moview Reviews used are given by the NLTK corpus and are tagged as being positive or negative. The main aim is to train a classifier on the data such that it can label new data, being the test data. We then compare the predicted test data with the actual labels to understand how well the classifier is working.\n",
